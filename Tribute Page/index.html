                <h2>About Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
                
                <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, was a political and spiritual leader in India who is widely regarded as the father of the Indian nation. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India.</p>
                <p>Gandhi studied law in London and then spent several years in South Africa, where he developed his philosophy of nonviolent resistance to injustice. He returned to India in 1915 and led the Indian National Congress in the struggle for Indian independence from British rule.</p>
                <p>Gandhi's nonviolent methods, such as civil disobedience, strikes, and boycotts, inspired other movements for social and political change around the world. He was a prolific writer and a passionate advocate for peace, justice, and human rights.</p>
